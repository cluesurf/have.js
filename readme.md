## TuneBond

This is being developed by the folks at [TuneBond](https://tune.bond), a
California-based project for helping humanity master information and
computation. TuneBond started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an
idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a
seed of a project just beginning its development phases. It is entirely
bootstrapped by working full time and running
[Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/tunebond) and
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also
find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tunebond),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/tunebond), and

other GitHub projects as well!
